Normally, ``npm install`` should do the trick. However, 
always there are problems with the dependencies. 

**How to fix them?**

First, edit the file ``package.json`` and replace all the
versions like ``^11.0.5`` to ``>=11.0.5``.

You will probably need to replace also the versions like 
``~4.0.3`` to ``>=4.0.3`` to achieve a correct installation.

And run ``npm install``: ``npm`` then will try to find a 
correct dependency set.
